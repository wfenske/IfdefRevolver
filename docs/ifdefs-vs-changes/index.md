# Online Appendix for "How Preprocessor Annotations (Do Not) Affect Maintainability: A Case Study on Change-Proneness"
  
## Tool Support

Data collection for this study was performed by
[IfdefRevolver](https://github.com/wfenske/IfdefRevolver/)
the Github project this page belongs to.
The entry point to the analysis is the Bourne shell script
`ifdefrevolve-project.sh`, located in `src/main/scripts`.
Type `ifdefrevolve-project.sh -h` at the command line to
get a help screen explaining the command line options.
This script relies on a number of helper scripts, which reside in
the same directory.
To get everything to run, this directory should be in the `PATH`
variable in your environment.

More information can be found on the [tool support page.](toolsupport.html)
