# IfdefRevolver

Examines correlations between CPP annotations (a.k.a. `#ifdef`s) and
negative effects, such as an increased proneness to faults or changes.

## Dependencies

IfdefRevolver depends on a number of other tools, some of them tools
developed by ourselves, some of them customized third-party tools, and
some third-party tools, used as is.

### Own tools and customized third-party tools

* cppstats: https://github.com/wfenske/cppstats

  Customized to improve performance for evolutionary analyses.  Also,
  some bugs were fixed. 

  Be sure to check out the `skunk` branch!  This branch contains
  the aforementioned customizations.

* Skunk: https://github.com/wfenske/Skunk

  Initially developed to detect variability-aware code smells, this
  version contains enhancements to report more metrics and to produce
  cleaner output in CSV files.  Function signature parsing was also
  improved.

  Be sure to check out the `skunk` branch!  This branch contains
  changed and new functionality that IfdefRevolver depends on.

* repodriller: https://github.com/wfenske/repodriller

  Enhanced to improve performance on large repositories with many
  commits.  Specifically, the time-consuming identification of
  branches for a commit was made optional.

  Again, use the code in the `skunk` branch!

### Other third-party tools

* srcML: http://www.srcml.org/

  Version used: Trunk 19109c, from May 22 2014

* CSVKit: https://github.com/wireservice/csvkit

  Set of command-line tools to work with CSV files.  Used extensively
  to aggregate and transform intermediate results.

  Version used: 1.0.2 (2016)
  
* xsltproc: http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/xsltproc.html

  A command line xslt processor, used internally by `cppstats`, e.g.,
  to remove comments.

* R: https://www.r-project.org/

  Used for statistical computations and figure creation.  The R
  scripts in `src/main/script` (extension `.R`) require it.

  Version used: 3.3.2 (2016-10-31) 

## Compatibility

`Ifdevrevolver` was successfully used under the following systems:

* Linux (Ubuntu, kernel 4.10.0-26-generic, x86\_64)

* macOS (kernel 16.6.0, x86_64)

Other Unix-like systems will probably work. Windows has not been tested. 

## Installation

1. Install srcML

   Make sure it is in your `PATH`, i.e., that `src2srcml` and
   `srcml2src` reside in a directory that is in the list of
   directories in your `PATH` environment variable.
   
1. Install xsltproc

   Under the Ubuntu distribution of Linux, the package `xsltproc`
   provides this program.  Again, make sure that `xsltproc` is in your
   `PATH`.  Otherwise, `cppstats` will terminate with errno 2 ("No
   such file or directory"), and the stackstrace will contain a call
   to `deleteComments`, which in turn calls `runBashCommand`.

1. Install cppstats

   Be sure to checkout out the correct fork and branch (see above).

   I installed cppstats using Python version 2.7.6, a somewhat dated
   Python version, because cppstats does not work with Python 3.
   Cppstats has a number of dependencies, such as `enum`, `pyparsing`,
   `statlib`, `lxml`, `pyparsing`.  Most, if not all of them, can be
   installed via Pythons `pip` packet manager.  Assuming Python is
   installed under `/opt/python-2.7.6`, the command would be

   `sudo -H /opt/python-2.7.6/bin/pip install pyparsing`

   After installing the prerequisites, install Cppstats itself via

   `sudo -H /opt/python-2.7.6/bin/python setup.py install`
	
   The main program, `cppstats`, also needs to be in your `PATH`.

1. Install xsltproc

   Xsltproc is available from the website mentioned above.
   Make sure it is in your `PATH` so that `cppstats`
   finds it at runtime.
   
1. Install CSVKit

   CSVKit is available from the website mentioned above.
   Make sure it is in your `PATH` so that the IfdefRevolver
   scripts find it at runtime.

1. Install Skunk

   Be sure to checkout out the correct fork and branch (see above).

   Installation works via Maven, i.e., go to the checkout, then change
   to the `Skunk` subdirectory (`cd Skunk`), then do

   `mvn install`

   Add the directory containing the script `skunk.sh` to your `PATH`.

1. Install repodriller

   Be sure to checkout out the correct fork and branch (see above).

   Installation works via Maven, i.e., go to the checkout, then do

   `mvn install`

1. Install IfdefRevolver 

   Installation works via Maven, i.e., go to the checkout, then do

   `mvn install`

   Add the IfdefRevolver's subdirectory `src/main/scripts` to your
   `PATH`.  E.g., if you checked out IfdefRevolver to
   `~/src/IfdefRevolver`, then add
   `~/src/IfdefRevolver/src/main/scripts` to your `PATH` variable.

## Running

1. Create a folder where you want to do your analysis and change to it.

1. Create a subfolder `repos` inside that folder.

1. Copy the smell detection definitions from Skunk:

   1. Create a directory `smellconfigs`

   1. Copy
      `<IfdefRevolver>/src/main/resources/smellconfigs/AnnotationBundle_low_thresholds.csm`
      to `smellconfigs/AnnotationBundle.csm`

   1. Copy some variant of `AnnotationFile.csm` from the same source
      directory to `smellconfigs/AnnotationFile.csm` (It's not
      actually used at this time.)

   1. Copy some variant of `LargeFeature.csm` from the same source
      directory to `smellconfigs/LargeFeature.csm` (It's not
      actually used at this time.)

1. Clone a repository:

   1. Go to the `repos` folder.

   1. Clone the repo, e.g.

      `git clone git@github.com:MyProject/myproject.git`
	  
   1. Change back up (`cd ..`)

1. Run `ifdefrevolver`:

   `ifdefrevolve-project.sh -p myproject`

   This will start the analysis.

   In case anything goes wrong:

   - You'll see some output such as

     ```make: *** [results/openvpn/.analysis_successful] Error 2```

   - Inspect the log messages are in the `logs` subdirectory.  A
	 subdirectory with the name of the analyzed project is
	 automatically created below the `logs` directory.  Different log
	 files are created for different phases of the analysis process:

     1. lscommits.log
     1. checkout.log
	 1. analyze.log

	 Find the one with the most recent timestamp to get to the bottom
	 of the error that last stopped you.

   - After fixing the problem (most likely a helper program not being
     found), you can continue the analysis with the same command you
     used to start it in the first place, e.g.:

     `ifdefrevolve-project.sh -p myproject`
	 
1. Analysis is done when the command finished without an error code
   and without suspicious output.  `analysis.log` should conclude with
   a line saying something like `Successfully processed 1 directories.`

1. Excluding snapshots

1. Grouping snapshots to windows
